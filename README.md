ZRAM can significantly improve system performance by compressing and decompressing memory pages, reducing the need to swap to slower disk storage.

Features:
- Easily turn on/off ZRAM compression to optimize memory usage.
- Check the current status and utilization of ZRAM.
- Fine-tune ZRAM parameters for optimal performance.
- User-friendly command-line interface with clear instructions.

Usage:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script with appropriate options to control ZRAM settings.
3. Enjoy improved system responsiveness and memory utilization.

Why should we use zram ?
- It's simple because you will have more ram (in cost of a little more power consumption) {but it worth it}
zram allow me to have more than 30 browser tabs on a low-ram system without getting killed by OOM
