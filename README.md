Features:
- Easily turn on/off ZRAM compression to optimize memory usage.
- Check the current status and utilization of ZRAM.
- Fine-tune ZRAM parameters for optimal performance.
- User-friendly command-line interface with clear instructions.

Usage:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script with appropriate options to control ZRAM settings.
3. Enjoy improved system responsiveness and memory utilization.

Whether you're a power user looking to fine-tune your system or a beginner seeking an efficient way to manage memory, this script provides a simple yet powerful solution.

Please note that this script is designed for Linux systems that support ZRAM. Use it responsibly and consider testing in a safe environment before making changes to critical systems.
